# Hello There!

## Why did I make this?

I use firefox alongside the `tree style tabs` extension, meaning I can nest tabs inside of tabs on a left bar (check this [link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) if you want to know more). Then I wanted to organize my tabs into groups, and I needed a "header" tab so-to-speak to represent that tab group. So I made this.

## Can I use it?

Of course. Do whatever you want to do with it.
